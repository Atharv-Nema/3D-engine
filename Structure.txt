    Point:
        Member variables:
            double x, y, z;
        Member function:
            double getX()
            double getY()
            double getZ()

            double moveZ()
            double moveX()
            //Notice that I haven't added changeY() as we won't be flying

    Cartesian:
        Member variables:
            Point origin;
            double alpha;
            double beta;

    Line:
        Member variables:
            Cartesian POV;
            Point p1,p2; //The end points

        Member functions:

            void draw() -> draws the line projected onto screen

    Player:
        Cartesian POV;//This POV will be passed by reference to every single object that needs it so that changes are reflected
